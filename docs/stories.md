## User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Feature ID | Priority |
|----|------------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| US1 | As a user, I want the game to start automatically when I turn on my computer | - Game launches at system startup<br>- Minimal impact on boot time<br>- Option to disable auto-start | F5 | High |
| US2 | As a user, I want the game state to be saved when I shut down my computer | - State automatically saved on shutdown<br>- State correctly restored on next launch<br>- Backup mechanism for corrupt saves | F4 | High |
